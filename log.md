# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created a new repository for Advice Picker App. Added starter HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts** I've forgotten some things about git and this is the first time using main instead of master since the change in Sept 2020.


### Day 2: Thursday, February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I fetched my URL endpoint for the advice picker.

**Thoughts**: I had to loop over an object which I don't usually do for APIs so that was a nice reminder, I got the data properly displaying in the console for now.

### Day 3: Saturday, February 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I displayed my API data in the DOM depending on a click event. I styled the color of the p tag with the advice using JS.

**Thoughts**: I knew what I had to do and I did it!
