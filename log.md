# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created a new repository for Advice Picker App. Added starter HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts** I've forgotten some things about git and this is the first time using main instead of master since the change in Sept 2020.
